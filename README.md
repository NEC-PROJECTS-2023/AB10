An Efficient Data Encryption Mechanism By Using Optimal Lsb Technique
I'm Shaik.Thameem Ansari and my team mates are K.Chaitanya and N.Balakrsihna.
Introduction:
  Images are the most widespread carrier medium. The are used for steganography in the following way. The message may firstly be encrypted. They are used for steganography in the following way. The message may firstly be encrypted. The sender embeds the secret message to be sent into a graphic file. This results in the production of what is called stego-image. Additional secret data may be needed in the hiding process e.g. a stegokey etc. This stego-image is then transmitted to the recipient.This project report intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steganography algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic techniques are more suitable for which applications. Steganography become more important as more people join the cyberspace revolution. Steganography is the art of concealing information in ways that prevents the detection of hidden messages. Steganography include an array of secret communication methods that hide the message from being seen or discovered.
